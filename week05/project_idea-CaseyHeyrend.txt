A tip/sales tax calculator, but the main focus is on the tip calculator, then the sales tax.
The tip calculator will add the tip to the bill amount, and if there are other people to pay that amount for the tip.

I think the element used for this is DOM events for the buttons, Some functions of some math and I guess fetching from the Math API.
